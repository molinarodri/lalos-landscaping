# Welcome to Lalo Landscaping
Lalo Landscaping is a Portland-based, family-owned business that keeps your property looking beautiful & works with you to transform it. 

I designed, wireframed and prototyped in Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/0qW5OTE3Q14sMIYcGRQmxh/Landscaping?node-id=318%3A2656).

## Resources
Here are the technologies I used to build Lalo Landscaping (aside from HTML, CSS, JS).

###### Tech
FormSubmit is a free service that offers easy form endpoints for your HTML forms. They email you the form submissions. See https://formsubmit.co/ for more details!

I used Flickity by metafizzy for touch, responsive, flickable carousels. See [flickity.metafizzy.co](flickity.metafizzy.co) for complete docs and demos.

###### Website Art
I used Figma's free Blush plug in for my avatars. Wavy Buddies
by Susana Salas offers doodle characters doing some online shopping! See [wavy buddies illustrations](https://blush.design/collections/0bopA8Y5vn29mdFBU2Br/wavy-buddies-illustrations) for more details.

Unsplash has over a million free high-resolution photos. All photos here are free to download and use under the Unsplash License. See https://unsplash.com/license for more details.
