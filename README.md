# Welcome to Lalo Landscaping
Lalo Landscaping is a Portland-based, family-owned business that keeps your property looking beautiful & works with you to transform it. 

I Designed, wireframed and prototyped in Figma here -> https://www.figma.com/file/0qW5OTE3Q14sMIYcGRQmxh/Landscaping?node-id=318%3A2656.

# Resources
Here are the technologies I used to build Lalo Landscaping (aside from HTML, SCSS, JS).

***Tech***
FormSubmit is a free service that offers easy form endpoints for your HTML forms. They email you the form submissions. See https://formsubmit.co/ for more details!

I used Flickity by metafizzy for touch, responsive, flickable carousels. See flickity.metafizzy.co for complete docs and demos.

***Website Art***
I used Figma's free Blush plug in for my avatars. Wavy Buddies
by Susana Salas offers doodle characters doing some online shopping! See https://blush.design/collections/0bopA8Y5vn29mdFBU2Br/wavy-buddies-illustrations for more details.

Unsplash has over a million free high-resolution photos. All photos here are free to download and use under the Unsplash License. See https://unsplash.com/license for more details.
